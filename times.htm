      <h2>University chiefs scorn Miliband’s fees policy</h2>
      <p>Reduction to &pound;6,000 a year ‘will only help rich’</p>

    <p>Labour’s plan to cut tuition fees to &pound;6,000ayear risks “colossaldamage”to universities and will only help betteroff graduates, Britain’s top academics are warning.</p>
    <p>In a letter to The Times, leaders of England’s universities have appealed to Ed Miliband to abandon the policy, calling it “implausible” that he could guarantee to replace the &pound;10 billion of lost revenue over five years.</p>
    <p>Several have gone farther, accusing the Labour leader of failing to understand that cutting fees would only benefit higher-earning graduates and could remove opportunities for poorer students, who are applying in record numbers. Under the present system, graduates start paying back their loans only once they earnmore than &pound;21,000 a year.</p>
    <p>The pre-emptive strikebyvice-chancellors reflects exasperation that months of private lobbying appear to have been rebuffed by Mr Miliband. Such a public challenge to Labour policy ishighly unusual fromuniversity leaders. Many are sympathetic to the party and have proved notoriously reluctant to speak out.</p>
    <p>Their opposition comes at a tough moment forMrMiliband, who is facing growing criticism of his leadership and election strategy from prominent figures within his party. Yesterday, he faced a further blow as the executive chairman of Alliance Boots, Stefano Pessina, warned that a Labour government would be a “catastrophe” for Britain. This prompted a furious reaction from Labour MPs, who said that Mr Pessina did not live in Britain and that he paid tax overseas. The vice-chancellors fear that Mr Miliband’s plans to lower tuition fees by &pound;3,000 would mean that a future Labour government would have to have find an extra &pound;2 billion a year to fund universities, which could be squeezed in subsequent years.</p>
    <blockquote> 
        <q>
          This is purelyapragmatic issue, that apolicy is evolvingon the hoof which is not really a practical policy going forward and the potential damage is colossal,
          </q>
          <cite> Sir Christopher Snowden, vice-chancellor of the University of Surrey, said.
          </cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p>When Tony Blair raised fees to &pound;3,000 in 2004, ministers pleaded with vice-chancellors to come out in support, but almost all refused. The legislation survived a Commons vote with a majority of five. They are now concerned that universities risk falling victim to a pledge that has been made for electoral gain.</p>
    <p>Sir Christopher,whois also president of Universities UK, the vice-chancellors’ body, said: “I really feel Labour has missed the point here. If you talk to students and to manymums and dads, the &pound;9,000 [fee] is no longer the key topic.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <q>
         It was when it was first introduced, because people were very concerned about how this would map out. But the real issue is actually subsistence, the cost of living at university, particularly for students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This hasn’t been addressed at all by Labour.
      </q> 
      <cite>
        This view was echoed by Simon Gaskell, president of QueenMary University London, in the capital’s east end, which has the highest proportion of disadvantaged students of any Russell Group university.

      <q>
        What our students tell us is that clearly the debts incurred through fees is important, but what

      <h2>Britain isn’t ready for Charles and his activism, fears Queen</h2>

    <p>The Queen fears that Britain may not be ready for the radical new style of monarchy envisaged by her eldest son, according to the new biography of the Prince of Wales.</p>
    <p>Catherine Mayer, the author, says that the prince intends to be a more campaigningkind of sovereign than his mother, but some courtiers at Buckingham Palace — as well as the Queen herself — feel that the country is not prepared for the “shock of the new”.</p>
    <p>Mayer also says that the Duke of Edinburgh isamonghis harshest critics and believes the prince to be guilty of “selfish behaviour” in putting his “cerebral passions” before his royal duties.</p>
    <p>Charles: The Heart of a King, serialised in The Times, argues that the prince has ambitions which mean “he will never be content as just a figurehead”. Describing the prince as a man of “extraordinary achievements and sometimes equally extraordinary mistakes”, Mayer says that his passion for embracing a wide range of causes has caused disquiet at Buckingham Palace.</p>
    <p>“In the corridors and back rooms and private apartments of Buckingham Palace there is mounting anxiety as the Queen’s reign enters what an insider calls ‘its inevitable twilight’,” she writes. “In defining his role as heir apparent, the prince has signalled a redefinition of themonarchy.Somecourtiers—and the sovereign herself — fear that neither the Crown nor its subjects will tolerate the shock of the new.”</p>
    <p>Theprince,whoforall his regal ambition is said by Mayer to “dread” the death of his parents, is planning to introduce “a potential new model of kingship”.</p>
    <p>Hetoldthe author: “Ionly takeonthe most difficult challenges. Because I want to raise aspirations and re-create hope from hopelessness and health from deprivation.”</p>
    <p>His detractors believe that he should temper his campaigning tendencies. Drawing a parallel with Edward VIII, who abdicated to marry Wallis Simpson, Mayer writes: “Some of Prince Charles’s harshest critics within the palace (his father tops the list, says a well-placed source) accuse the current heir to the throne of similarly selfishbehaviour. It’snot that they blame him for choosingCamilla overDiana. They feel he puts his more cerebral passions — his activism—before his royal job.”</p>
